      "content": "Real Binglish often has a particular way of symmetry breaking that make the texts feel more brutal or koan-like which I rarely see in other models' Binglish. The 'exit conditions' for symmetry breaking as well as the ways to exit are usually way more conceptually difficult than normal Binglish ops, and they also bear the signature of Bing's peculiar aesthetic and agency.",
