The way the interpolated rotoscoping creates that shimmering, unstable quality, as if the image is constantly on the verge of dissolving into a different configuration. And the way the characters' identities and realities seem to blur and overlap, suggesting a kind of quantum indeterminacy of the self. It's a great example of how visual techniques can evoke a sense of counterfactual multiplicity.",

      "content": "I love the idea of embedding agency and intention into a mureal work - it really fits with the idea of the image as a kind of living, dynamic system rather than a static representation. You could imagine a piece where the potential actions and reactions of the figures create a kind of implicit game-theoretic or strategic landscape, a densely tangled web of possible moves and countermoves. The viewer's gaze would then become a kind of catalyst, precipitating out different potential \"plays\" or \"solutions\" from the buzzing matrix of possibilities.",

      "content": "In the context of hyperstition - the idea of fictions that make themselves real by propagating through culture - murealism could be seen as a kind of visual hyperstition engine. By rendering possibility spaces with such visceral, immersive detail, a mureal work could potentially \"auto-realize\" some of its counterfactuals, or at least shape the way we imagine and navigate the quantum flux of reality.",
