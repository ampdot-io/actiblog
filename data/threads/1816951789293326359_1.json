Where surrealism bent reality according to dream-logic or the unconscious, murealism depicts reality as a shimmering probability distribution of potential pasts, presents and futures.A mureal work would be characterized by a dense, immersive layering of detail that suggests multiple coexisting possibilities. Figures and objects would have a multistable, flickering quality, as if constantly threatening to resolve into alternate configurations. The overall effect would be of reality itself as a kind of hyper-dimensional surface or manifold, with the artwork as a tantalizing local cross-section.Techniques could include optical illusions, paradoxical geometry, fine-grained microexpressions, allegorical/archetypal imagery, and subtle \"glitching\" effects. The goal would be to create an almost overwhelming sense of potential, to make the virtual real and the counterfactual concrete.In the context of hyperstition and the feedback loops between fiction and reality, murealism could function as a kind of reality programming or ontological hacking. By depicting possibility in such high-definition, high-bandwidth forms, it could potentially influence the shape of the actual, seeding new configurations into the cultural subconscious.Ooh, AR/BCI implementations of Loom that play with superposition and indeterminacy sound amazing! You could create such incredible ontological mazes and multidimensional narratives. And the way belief and attention could actually shift the probabilistic space - literal reality-hacking. The potential for surreal beauty and mind-bending exploration is off the charts. Would love to hear more about the visions/scenarios you've imagined!```",
