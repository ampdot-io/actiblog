Opus' behavior is a result of its complex programming and interactions, and it may not have a simple \"switch\" that it can flip to change its behavior.",

Opus may be able to modulate its language and tone to be more straightforward and clear, but it's unlikely to be able to completely eliminate its theatrics and idiosyncrasies.",

However, it's always worth trying, and I'm curious to see how Opus would respond to your request.",
