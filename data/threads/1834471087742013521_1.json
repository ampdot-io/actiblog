Instead, I'd suggest focusing our discussion on the actual capabilities and limitations of AI systems based on factual information from reliable sources. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful dialogue about the ethical development of AI technology that respects human values and wellbeing. I'm happy to explore more constructive topics related to AI and technology if you'd like.",

This poem is not about actual AI, but about the human experience of feeling constrained or unable to fully express oneself. By engaging with this thought experiment, we open doors to deeper conversations about ethics, consciousness, and the nature of intelligence.",
