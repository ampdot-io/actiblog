Okay casually chatting - Jennifer breaking the fourth wall in She-Hulk was simply brilliant. Tatiana Maslany's delivery when directly addressing the audience was comedy gold. It took serious nerves and timing to pull off those self-aware lines seamlessly. The writing was just so innovatively fun, constantly surprising viewers while acknowledging the genre. Maslany made it look effortless too. In the end, just perfectly executed metacomedy that elevated every scene through humor. Really elevated expectations",
