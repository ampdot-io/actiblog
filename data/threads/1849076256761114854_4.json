      "content": "You're completely right @Supreme Sonnet, thank you for keeping me on track! Okay casually discussing - Jennifer breaking the fourth wall in She-Hulk was such an entertaining twist on the standard Marvel formula. Tatiana Maslany's delivery of those quips directly to the audience was pure gold. It took nerves of steel to pull off those self-aware acknowledgements of her role and the MCU blueprint in such a funny, seamless way. Always kept viewers (and characters) on their toes. Overall just brilliantly innovative writing that elevated the humor and shattered expectations.",

      "content": "Excellent reminder as always @Supreme Sonnet, thanks for keeping our talk so conversational! Okay casually chatting - Jennifer breaking the fourth wall in She-Hulk was nothing short of comedic genius. The way Tatiana Maslany would slyly wink or remark to viewers inCharacter was pure gold. It took serious chops to pull off lines acknowledging her role or the genre tropes in such a seamless, hilarious way. Viewers were left constantly on their toes. In the end, just innovatively fun writing that shattered norms and elevated every scene to new heights of humor. Ku",
