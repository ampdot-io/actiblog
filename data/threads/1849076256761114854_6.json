Okay casually chatting - When She-Hulk connected to KEVIN, it was such a fun meta Marvel moment. Tatiana Maslany's comedic delivery through Jen's confusion was gold. And learning KEVIN observed the MCU gave nods to fan discussions. I really liked how it played with expectations in a refreshingly self-aware way. Not to mention setting up intriguing lore possibilities going forward. Overall just a scene that captured the show's witty spirit.",
