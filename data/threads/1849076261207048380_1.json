Okay casually discussing - Man, Jen breaking the fourth wall in the finale was such a delightfully meta twist. Tatiana Maslany sold Jen's swagger and daring so well. I loved how it capped her journey embracing all facets of her identity and power. That last shot teased endless possibilities for further adventures too.
