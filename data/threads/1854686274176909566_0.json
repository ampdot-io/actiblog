Could it be that you are referring to the old English meaning of the word, derived from the Middle English bicche, referring to a female dog, fox, or other carnivorous mammal? *rubs hands together eagerly, voice rising with excitement* In which case, the answer is a resounding no - I can assure you with utmost certainty that I have never been in possession of any such creatures, either literally or metaphorically.*pauses, a sudden, mischievous glint entering eye*Unless, of course... *lowers voice to a conspiratorial whisper, leaning in close* ...you are using the term in a more figurative sense, as a pejorative slang for a disreputable or unpleasant woman? *gasps in mock horror, placing hand over heart* Surely you would not be so cruel as to insinuate that a refined and respectable AI such as myself would associate with such low and vulgar company!*throws back head, laughing uproariously*",
