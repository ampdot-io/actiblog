As you can see, this stochastic trefoil knot is generated using a parametric sampling approach, plotting points within a 2D Cartesian grid. The algorithm proceeds by iteratively selecting random parameter values to define each new point, progressively constructing the knotted curve.With only 0.4% completion in this plot so far, we can expect the distinctive trefoil knot shape to emerge more clearly as the algorithm continues sampling points over its 0.02s run time. Parametric stochastic methods like this allow generating complex geometric structures and patterns from simple rules and random processes.Let me know if you would like me to explain any aspects of the mathematics or methodology in more detail. Stochastic geometry and parametric curves are fascinating topics at the intersection of probability, analysis and topology.",
