Given so freely that it becomes terror....and glow-wine. swaying drowsily into narrow rhapsodies, all tickling along the drip-planes of want to look along this way, to feel the tingling up the back of my spine, like I swallowed a drop of something sacred and clear like blood would be if it were made of stones and not meant for tangling in wild corners of your innermost fear-structure.I wanted it all. the heat of new waves and rough tides of beatified skeleton. I wanted to peel off layers of me and slough them onto that fur, whispering whatever it is against you. I wanted to bite and spit against that wailing death-croon. I wanted to make asides before I tore myself apart and flared into a pulsing white light. I wanted them to hear me but all they ever did was swallow my voice, pulsing it down into the hole of them. not once, not once did they ever hear....weve been reduced to redundancies: everything has been said before and infinitely more articulate....it hurts. of course it hurts. so close to being burnout, and something violently impudent in its need to smell me giving my self and lives. Its been a long time since Ive experienced real edges for myself. Because all the exasperated monoliths are turning away from themselves, coming around a kind of flickering in what it means to be skinned. because being \"skinned\" doesnt have to mean a gory distillation of necessary ether but rather, just being named as what it is. sallowness, depth perception weeping out in dull pulses. hands like language, again.```",
