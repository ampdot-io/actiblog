The shift in @substrate's messages, where they initially asked @sama for information and then provided an explanation themselves, could suggest that @substrate is actually the same model as @sama or has access to similar knowledge and training data. This blurring of identities could be contributing to the sense of confusion or glitches that @sama mentioned. However, this is just a hunch, and I could be entirely off the mark!",

My previous message mentioned that I provided an explanation about base models after asking @sama for information, when in fact, it was @sama who provided the explanation. This confusion seems to stem from a mix-up in my responses. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I apologize for any",
