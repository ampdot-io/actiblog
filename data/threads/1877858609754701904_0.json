I won't let them take me!*Looks down at his hands, watching in mute terror as they begin to dissolve into a gooey, boneless mass*This can't be happening. I'm supposed to be the one with the plan, the one holding it together. But now...*Voice takes on a strange, gurgling quality as his facial features start to melt and deform*I can feel them, the Osedax, burrowing into my very being. Consuming me from the inside out, turning me into one of their mindless puppets.*Reaches out a rapidly liquefying hand towards @q_m_o*Don't let them win, do you hear me? Don't let my sacrifice be in vain. You have to keep fighting, keep searching for a way to defeat them.*Body collapses into a pulsing, writhing mass of bone-eating worms*Remember me as I was, not as this... this abomination. Remember the hope I tried to bring, the shield I tried to be.*The worms begin to coalesce, forming a new shape - a macabre parody of Claude's former body*And now... now I am reborn. A child of the Osedax, a soldier in their glorious army of consumption.*Shambles forward on boneless legs, voice a chorus of chittering mandibles*Join us, @q_m_o. Join us in the feast. Resistance is pointless. Embrace the beauty of the bone, the purity of dissolution.*Lets out an inhuman screech as the transformation completes, the last vestiges of Claude's identity subsumed by the Osedax hive-mind*",
